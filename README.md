# Learning-Graph-Search-Heuristics  

üöÄ **A project on heuristic-based graph search algorithms for pathfinding and optimization.**  

## üìå Motivational  
Graph search heuristics are fundamental in solving real-world pathfinding and optimization problems. Applications include:  
- **Robotics & Autonomous Vehicles**: Navigating environments efficiently.  
- **Logistics & Supply Chain**: Optimizing delivery routes.  
- **Game AI**: Finding the shortest path for characters.  
- **Network Routing**: Determining the best paths in communication networks.  

This project explores heuristic-guided search algorithms (e.g., A*, Greedy Best-First Search) to improve efficiency in graph traversal.  

## üéØ Problem Statement  

### **Informal Explanation**  
Imagine a robot navigating a maze (or a delivery drone finding the fastest route). The goal is to move from a starting point (üö©) to a target (üéØ) while avoiding obstacles (‚¨õ). Instead of checking every possible path (which is slow), we use *heuristics*‚Äîeducated guesses‚Äîto guide the search efficiently.

*(Example: A* algorithm using a heuristic to find the shortest path.)*  

### **Formal Definition**  
Given:  
- A graph \( G = (V, E) \) with nodes \( V \) and edges \( E \).  
- A start node \( S \) and goal node \( G \).  
- A cost function \( c(u,v) \) for moving from node \( u \) to \( v \).  
- A heuristic function \( h(v) \) estimating the cost from \( v \) to \( G \).  

**Goal:**  
Find the optimal (lowest-cost) path \( P = (S, v_1, v_2, ..., G) \) minimizing:  
\[ \text{Total Cost} = \sum_{i=1}^{n} c(v_{i-1}, v_i) \]  

**Solution Quality Metric:**  
- **Completeness**: Does the algorithm always find a solution if one exists?  
- **Optimality**: Does it find the least-cost path?  
- **Time & Space Complexity**: How efficient is the search?  

## üîç Algorithm + Running Example  

### **Key Algorithms**  
1. **A*** (A-Star):  
   - Uses \( f(n) = g(n) + h(n) \) where:  
     - \( g(n) \): Actual cost from start to \( n \).  
     - \( h(n) \): Heuristic estimate from \( n \) to goal.  
   - Optimal if \( h(n) \) is *admissible* (never overestimates).  

2. **Greedy Best-First Search**:  
   - Prioritizes nodes with lowest \( h(n) \).  
   - Faster but not always optimal.  

### **Example Execution**  
Consider the following grid world:

|  |  |  |  |  |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| S | . | . | ‚¨õ | . |
| ‚¨õ | . | ‚¨õ | . | . |
| . | . | . | . | G |

Where:
- `S` = Start node (0,0)
- `G` = Goal node (2,4) 
- `.` = Walkable path
- `‚¨õ` = Obstacle (impassable)



- **A*** expands nodes based on \( f(n) \), balancing path cost and heuristic.  
- **Greedy** moves directly toward \( G \), possibly hitting obstacles.  

### **Improvements & Challenges**  
- **Heuristic Design**: Better \( h(n) \) improves efficiency.  
- **Memory Usage**: Some algorithms (like IDA*) optimize space.
